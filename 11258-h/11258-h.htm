<h2>
PREFACE</h2>

<hr/>
<p>
Wassailing, prefaces, and waits, are nearly at a stand-still; and in
these days of universality and everything, we almost resolved to leave
this page blank, and every reader to write his own preface, had we not
questioned whether the custom would be more honoured in the breach than
the observance.
</p><p>
My Public&mdash;that is, our readers&mdash;we have served you seven years, through
fourteen volumes; in each renewing our professions of gratitude, and
study for your gratification; and we hope we shall not presume on your
liberal disposition by calculating on your continued patronage. We have
endeavoured to keep our engagements with you&mdash;<i>to the letter</i><a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>&mdash;as
they say in weightier matters; and, as every man is bound to speak of
the fair as he has found his market in it, we ought to acknowledge the
superabundant and quick succession of literary novelties for the present
volume. There is little of our own; because we have uniformly taken Dr.
Johnson's advice in life&mdash;"to play for much, and stake little" This will
extenuate our assuming that "from castle to cottage we are regularly
taken in:" indeed, it would be worse than vanity to suppose that price
or humble pretensions should exclude us; it would be against the very
economy of life to imagine this; and we are still willing to abide by
such chances of success.
</p>
<p>
Cheap Books, we hope, will never be an evil; for, as "the same care and
toil that raise a dish of peas at Christmas, would give bread to a whole
family during six months;" so the expense of a gay volume at this season
will furnish a moderate circle with amusive reading for a twelvemonth.
We do not draw this comparison invidiously, but merely to illustrate the
advantages of literary economy.
</p><p>
The number <i>Seven</i>&mdash;the favourite of Swift, (and how could it be
otherwise than odd?) has, perhaps, led us into this rambling monologue
on our merits; but we agree with Yorick in thinking gravity an errant
scoundrel.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiii" name="pageiii"></a>[pg iii]</span>
A proportionate Index will guide our accustomed readers to any
particular article in the present volume; but for those of shorter
acquaintance, a slight reference to its principal points may be useful.
Besides, a few of its delights may have been choked by weeds and
crosses, and their recollection lost amidst the lights and shadows
of busy life.
</p><p>
The zeal of our Correspondents is first entitled to honourable mention;
and many of their contributions to these pages must have cost them much
time and research; for which we beg them to accept our best thanks.
</p><p>
Of the Selections, generally, we shall only observe, that our aim has
been to convey information and improvement in the most amusing form.
When we sit down to the pleasant task of cutting open&mdash;not cutting
<i>up</i>&mdash;a book, we say, "If this won't turn out something, another will;
no matter&mdash;'tis an essay upon human nature. (We) get (our) labour for
(our) pains&mdash;'tis enough&mdash;the pleasure of the experiment has kept (our)
senses, and the best part of (our) blood awake, and laid the gross to
sleep." In this way we find many good things, and banish the rest;
we attempt to "boke something new," and revive others. Thus we have
described the Siamese Twins in a single number; and in others we
have brought to light many almost forgotten antiquarian rarities.
</p><p>
Of Engravings, Paper, and Print, we need say but little: each speaks
<i>primâ facie,</i> for itself. Improvement has been studied in all of
them; and in the Cuts, both interest and execution have been cardinal
points. Milan Cathedral; Old Tunbridge Wells and its Old Visitors;
Clifton; Gurney's Steam Carriage; and the Bologna Towers; are perhaps
the best specimens: and by way of varying architectural embellishments,
a few of the Wonders of Nature have been occasionally introduced.
</p><p>
Owen Feltham would call this "a cart-rope" Preface: therefore, with
promises of future exertion, we hope our next Seven Years may be as
successful as the past.

<h3>
MEMOIR OF THOMAS CAMPBELL, ESQ.</h3>

<p>
Of the subject of this memoir, it has been remarked, "that he has not,
that we know of, written one line, which, dying, he could wish to blot."
These few words will better illustrate the fitness of Mr. Campbell's
portrait for our volume, than a laudatory memoir of many pages. He has
not inaptly been styled the Tyrtaeus of modern English poetry, and one
of the most chaste and tender as well as original of poets. He owes less
than any other British poet to his predecessors and contemporaries.
He has lived to see his lines quoted like those of earlier poets in the
literature of his day, lisped by children, and sung at public festivals.
The war-odes of Campbell have scarcely anything to match them in-the
English language for energy and fire, while their condensation and the
felicitous selection of their versification are in remarkable harmony.
Campbell, in allusion to Cymon, has been said to have "conquered both
on land and sea," from his Naval Odes and "Hohenlinden" embracing both
scenes of warfare.
</p><p>
Scotland gave birth to Thomas Campbell. He is the son of a second
marriage, and was born at Glasgow, in 1777. His father was born in 1710,
and was consequently nearly seventy years of age when the poet, his son,
was ushered into the world. He was sent early to school, in his native
place, and his instructor was Dr. David Alison, a man of great celebrity
in the practice of education. He had a method of instruction in the
classics purely his own, by which he taught with great facility, and
at the same time rejected all harsh discipline, substituting kindness
for terror, and alluring rather than compelling the pupil to his duty.
Campbell began to write verse when young; and some of his earliest
attempts at poetry are yet extant among his friends in Scotland. For his
place of education he had a great respect, as well as for the memory of
his masters, of whom he always spoke in terms of great affection. He was
twelve years old when he quitted school for the University of Glasgow.
There he was considered an excellent Latin scholar, and gained high
honour by a contest with a candidate twice as old as himself, by which
he obtained a bursary. He constantly bore away the prizes, and every
fresh success only seemed to stimulate him to more ambitious exertions.
In Greek he was considered the foremost student of his age; and some
of his translations are said to be superior to any before offered for
competition in the University. While there he made poetical paraphrases
of the most celebrated Greek poets; of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Aristophanes, which were thought efforts of extraordinary promise.
Dr. Millar at that time gave philosophical lectures in Glasgow. He was
a highly gifted teacher, and excellent man. His lectures attracted the
attention of young Campbell, who became his pupil, and studied with
eagerness the principles of sound philosophy; the poet was favoured
with the confidence of his teacher, and partook much of his society.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>
Campbell quitted Glasgow to remove into Argyleshire, where a situation
in a family of some note was offered and accepted by him. It was in
Argyleshire,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> among the romantic mountains of the north, that his
poetical spirit increased, and the charms of verse took entire
possession of his mind. Many persons now alive remember him wandering
there alone by the torrent, or over the rugged heights of that wild
country, reciting the strains of other poets aloud, or silently
composing his own. Several of his pieces which he has rejected in his
collected works, are handed about in manuscript in Scotland. We quote
one of these wild compositions which has hitherto appeared only in
periodical publications.

DIRGE OF WALLACE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>They lighted a taper at the dead of night,</p>
<p class="i2">  And chanted their holiest hymn;</p>
<p>But her brow and her bosom were damp with affright</p>
<p class="i2">  Her eye was all sleepless and dim!</p>
<p>And the lady of Elderslie wept for her lord,</p>
<p class="i2">  When a death-watch beat in her lonely room,</p>
<p>When her curtain had shook of its own accord;</p>
<p class="i2">  And the raven had flapp'd at her window-board,</p>
<p>To tell of her warrior's doom!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  Now sing you the death-song, and loudly pray</p>
<p class="i2">  For the soul of my knight so dear;</p>
<p>And call me a widow this wretched day,</p>
<p class="i2">  Since the warning of God is here!</p>
<p>For night-mare rides on my strangled sleep:</p>
<p class="i2">  The lord of my bosom is doomed to die:</p>
<p>His valorous heart they have wounded deep;</p>
<p>And the blood-red tears shall his country weep,</p>
<p class="i2">  For Wallace of Elderslie!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yet knew not his country that ominous hour,</p>
<p class="i2">  Ere the loud matin bell was rung,</p>
<p>That a trumpet of death on an English tower</p>
<p class="i2">  Had the dirge of her champion sung!</p>
<p>When his dungeon light look'd dim and red</p>
<p class="i2">  On the high-born blood of a martyr slain,</p>
<p>No anthem was sung at his holy death-bed;</p>
<p>No weeping was there when his bosom bled&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">  And his heart was rent in twain!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, it was not thus when his oaken spear</p>
<p class="i2">  Was true to that knight forlorn;</p>
<p>And the hosts of a thousand were scatter'd like deer,</p>

<p>When he strode on the wreck of each well-fought field</p>
<p class="i2">  With the yellow-hair'd chiefs of his native land;</p>
<p>For his lance was not shiver'd on helmet or shield&mdash;</p>
<p>And the sword that seem'd fit for Archangel to wield,</p>

<p class="i2">  A nobler was never embalm'd!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
From Argyleshire, where his residence was not a protracted one, Campbell
removed to Edinburgh. There he soon became introduced to some of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span>
the
first men of the age, whose friendship and kindness could not fail
to stimulate a mind like that of Campbell. He became intimate with the
late Dugald Stewart; and almost every other leading professor of the
University of Edinburgh was his friend. While in Edinburgh, he brought
out his celebrated "Pleasures of Hope," at the age of twenty-one. It is
perhaps not too much to say of this work, that no poet of this country
ever produced, at so early an age, a more elaborate and finished
performance. For this work, which for twenty years produced the
publishers between two and three hundred pounds a year, the author
received at first but £10, which was afterwards increased by an
additional sum, and by the profits of a quarto edition of the work. By
a subsequent act of the legislature, extending the term of copyright,
it reverted again to the author; but with no proportional increase of
profit. Campbell's pecuniary circumstances are said to have been by no
means easy at this time and a pleasant anecdote is recorded of him, in
allusion to the hardships of an author's case, somewhat similar to his
own: he was desired to give a toast at a festive moment when the
character of Napoleon was at its utmost point of disesteem in England.
He gave "Bonaparte." The company started with astonishment. "Gentlemen,"
said he, "here is Bonaparte in his character of executioner of the
booksellers." Palm, the bookseller, had just been executed in Germany,
by the orders of the French.
</p><p>
After residing nearly three years in Edinburgh, Campbell quitted his
native country for the Continent. He sailed for Hamburgh, and there made
many acquaintances among the more enlightened circles, both of that
city and Altona. At that time there were numerous Irish exiles in the
neighbourhood of Hamburgh, and some of them fell in the way of the
poet, who afterwards related many curious anecdotes of them. There
were sincere and honest men among them, who, with the energy of their
national character, and enthusiasm for liberty, had plunged into the
desperate cause of the rebellion two years before, and did not, even
then, despair of freedom and equality in Ireland. Some of them were
in private life most amiable persons, and their fate was altogether
entitled to sympathy. The poet, from that compassionate feeling which
is an amiable characteristic of his nature, wrote <i>The Exile of Erin</i>,
from the impression their situation and circumstances made upon his
mind. It was set to an old Irish air, of the most touching pathos,
and will perish only with the language.
</p><p>
Campbell travelled over a great part of Germany and Prussia&mdash;visiting
the Universities, and storing his mind with German literature. From
the walls of a convent he commanded a view of part of the field of
Hohenlinden during that sanguinary contest, and proceeded afterwards in
the track of Moreau's army over the scene of combat. This impressive
sight produced the <i>Battle of Hohenlinden</i>&mdash;an ode which is as
original as it is spirited, and stands by itself in British literature.
The poet tells a story of the phlegm of a German postilion at this time,
who was driving him post by a place where a skirmish of cavalry had
happened, and who alighted and disappeared, leaving the carriage and the
traveller alone in the cold (for the ground was covered with snow) for
a considerable space of time. At length he came back; and it was found
that he had been employing himself in cutting off the long tails of the
slain horses, which he coolly placed on the vehicle, and drove on his
route. Campbell was also in Ratisbon when the French and Austrian
treaty saved it from bombardment.
</p><p>
In Germany Campbell made the friendship of the two Schlegels, of many of
the first literary and political characters, and was fortunate enough to
pass an entire day with the venerable Klopstock, who died just two years
afterwards. The proficiency of Campbell in the German language was
rendered very considerable by this tour, and his own indefatigable
perseverance in study. His travels in Germany occupied him thirteen
months; when he returned to England, and, for the first time, visited
London. He soon afterwards composed those two noble marine odes, <i>The
Battle of the Baltic,</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span>
<i>Ye Mariners of England</i>, which, with his
<i>Hohenlinden</i>, stand unrivalled in the English tongue; and though,
as Byron lamented, Campbell has written so little, these odes alone are
enough to place him unforgotten in the shrine of the Muses.
</p><p>
In 1803 the poet married Miss Sinclair, a lady of Scottish descent, and
considerable personal beauty, but of whom he was deprived by death in
1828. He resided at Sydenham, and the entire neighbourhood of that
pleasant village reckoned itself in the circle of his friends; nor did
he quit his suburban retreat until, in 1821, literary pursuits demanded
his residence in the metropolis. It was at Sydenham, in a house nearly
facing the reservoir, that the poet produced his greatest work,
<i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>, written in the Spenserian stanza. About the
same time Campbell was appointed Professor of Poetry in the Royal
Institution, where he delivered lectures which have since been
published. He also undertook the editorship of <i>Selections from the
British Poets</i>, intended as specimens of each, and accompanied with
critical remarks.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Soon after the publication of his "Specimens," he revisited Germany, and
passed some time in Vienna, where he acquired a considerable knowledge
of the Austrian court and its manners. He remained long at Bonn, where
his friend, W.A. Schlegel, resides. Campbell returned to England in
1820, to undertake the editorship of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>,
and coupled with his name, it has risen to a very extensive circulation.
In 1824, Campbell published his "Theodric, a Domestic Tale," the least
popular of his works.
</p><p>
By his marriage Campbell had two sons. One of them died before attaining
his twentieth year; the other, while in the University of Bonn, where
he was placed for his education, exhibited symptoms of an erring mind,
which, on his return to England soon afterwards, ripened into mental
derangement of the milder species. After several years passed in this
way, during which the mental disease considerably relaxed, so that young
Campbell became wholly inoffensive, and his father received him into his
house. The effect of this upon a mind of the most exquisite sensibility
like the poet's, may be readily imagined: it was, at times, a source of
the keenest suffering.
</p><p>
We must now allude to an event in Campbell's life, which will ensure him
the gratitude of ages to come: we mean as the originator of the London
University. Four years before it was made public, the idea occurred
to him, from his habit of visiting the Universities of Germany, and
studying their regulations. He communicated it at first to two or three
friends, until his ideas upon the subject became matured, when they
were made public, and a meeting upon the business convened in London,
which Mr. Campbell addressed, and where the establishment of such an
institution met the most zealous support. Once in operation, several
public men of high talent, headed by Mr. Brougham, lost not a moment
in forwarding the great and useful object in view. The undertaking was
divided into shares, which were rapidly taken; but Mr. Campbell left the
active arrangements to others, and contented himself with attending the
committees. With unexampled rapidity the London University has been
completed, or nearly so, and Campbell has had the satisfaction of seeing
his projected instrument of education almost in full operation in less
than three years after he made the scheme public. Although one of the
most important,<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> this is not the only public-spirited event of this
description, in Mr. Campbell's life; for he was instrumental in the
establishment of the Western Literary Institution, in Leicester Square;
and at the present time he is, we believe, in conjunction with other
eminent literary men, organizing a club to be entitled the Literary
Union, whose lists already contain upwards of 300 men of talent,
including Sir Walter Scott and all the principal periodical writers
of the day.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>[pg ix]</span>
Campbell, as has already been observed, was educated at Glasgow, and
received the honour of election as Lord Rector, three successive years,
notwithstanding the opposition of the professors, and the excellent
individuals who were placed against him; among whom were the late
minister Canning, and Sir Walter Scott. The students of Glasgow College
considered that the celebrity of the poet, his liberal principles, his
being a fellow-townsman, and his attention to their interests, entitled
him to the preference.
</p><p>
In person, Mr. Campbell is below the middle stature, well made,
but slender. His features indicate great sensibility; his eyes are
particularly striking, and of a deep blue colour; his nose aquiline;
his expression generally saturnine. His step is light, but firm; and
he appears to possess much more energy of constitution than men of
fifty-two who have been studious in their habits, exhibit in general.
His time for study is mostly during the stillness of night, when he
can be wholly abstracted from external objects. He is remarkable for
absence of mind; is charitable and kind in his disposition, but of quick
temper. His amusements are few; the friend and conversation only; and
in the "flow of soul" there are few men possessing more companionable
qualities. His heart is perhaps one of the best that beats in a human
bosom: "it is," observes a biographer, "that which should belong to
the poet of <i>Gertrude,</i> his favourite personification."
</p><p>
To exhibit the poet in the social circle, as well as to introduce a very
piquant portrait, drawn by a friend, we subjoin a leaf or two from Leigh
Hunt's <i>Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries</i><a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>&mdash;displaying
all the graphic ease for which Mr. Hunt is almost without a rival:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
I forget how I became acquainted with Mr. Hill, proprietor of the
<i>Monthly Mirror;</i> but at his house at Sydenham I used to meet his
editor, Mr. Dubois, Mr. Campbell, who was his neighbour, and the two
Smiths, authors of <i>The Rejected Addresses.</i> Once or twice I saw
also Mr. Theodore Hook, and Mr. Matthews, the comedian. Our host (and
I thought him no older the other day than he was then) was a jovial
bachelor, plump and rosy as an abbot: and no abbot could have presided
over a more festive Sunday. The wine flowed merrily and long; the
discourse kept pace with it; and next morning, in returning to town,
we felt ourselves very thirsty. A pump by the road side, with a plash
round it, was a bewitching sight.
</p><p>
"They who know Mr. Campbell only as the author of <i>Gertrude of
Wyoming</i> and the <i>Pleasures of Hope,</i> would not suspect him to
be a merry companion, overflowing with humour and anecdote, and any
thing but fastidious. These Scotch poets have always something in
reserve: it is the only point in which the major part of them resemble
their countrymen. The mistaken character which the lady formed of
Thomson from his <i>Seasons</i> is well known. He let part of the secret
out in his <i>Castle of Indolence;</i> and the more he let out, the more
honour he did to the simplicity and cordiality of the poet's nature,
though not always to the elegance of it. Allan Ramsay knew his friends
Gay and Somerville as well in their writings, as he did when he came to
be personally acquainted with them; but Allan, who had bustled up from
a barber's shop into a bookseller's, was 'a cunning shaver;' and nobody
would have guessed the author of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> to be
penurious. Let none suppose that any insinuation to that effect is
intended against Mr. Campbell: he is one of the few men whom I could at
any time walk half-a-dozen miles through the snow to spend an afternoon
with; and I could no more do this with a penurious man than I could
with a sulky one. I know but of one fault he has, besides an extreme
cautiousness in his writings; and that one is national, a matter of
words, and amply overpaid by a stream of conversation, lively, piquant,
and liberal&mdash;not the less interesting for occasionally betraying an
intimacy with pain, and for a high and somewhat strained tone of voice,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>[pg x]</span>
like a man speaking with suspended breath, and in the habit of subduing
his feelings. No man, I should guess, feels more kindly towards his
fellow-creatures, or takes less credit for it. When he indulges in doubt
and sarcasm, and speaks contemptuously of things in general, he does it,
partly, no doubt, out of actual dissatisfaction, but more perhaps than
he suspects, out of a fear of being thought weak and sensitive&mdash;which is
a blind that the best men very commonly practise. Mr. Campbell professes
to be hopeless and sarcastic, and takes pains all the while to set up an
university.

"When I first saw this eminent person, he gave me the idea of a French
Virgil: not that he is like a Frenchman, much less the French translator
of Virgil. I found him as handsome as the Abbé Delille is said to have
been ugly. But he seemed to me to embody a Frenchman's ideal notion of
the Latin poet; something a little more cut and dry than I had looked
for; compact and elegant, critical and acute, with a consciousness of
authorship upon him; a taste over-anxious not to commit itself, and
refining and diminishing nature as in a drawing-room mirror. This fancy
was strengthened in the course of conversation, by his expatiating on
the greatness of Racine. I think he had a volume of the French Tragedian
in his hand. His skull was sharply cut and fine; with plenty, according
to the phrenologists, both of the reflective and amative organs; and his
poetry will bear them out. For a lettered solitude and a bridal properly
got up, both according to law and luxury, commend us to the lovely
<i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>. His face and person were rather on a small
scale; his features regular; his eye lively and penetrating; and when he
spoke, dimples played about his mouth, which nevertheless had something
restrained and close in it. Some gentle puritan seemed to have crossed
the breed, and to have left a stamp on his face, such as we often see
in the female Scotch face rather than the male. But he appeared not
at all grateful for this; and when his critiques and his Virgilianism
were over, very unlike a puritan he talked! He seemed to spite his
restrictions; and out of the natural largeness of his sympathy with
things high and low, to break at once out of Delille's Virgil into
Cotton's, like a boy let loose from school. When I have the pleasure
of hearing him now, I forget his Virgilianisms, and think only of the
delightful companion, the unaffected philanthropist, and the creator
of a beauty worth all the heroines in Racine.
</p><p>
"Mr. Campbell has tasted pretty sharply of the good and ill of the
present state of society, and for a book-man has beheld strange sights.
He witnessed a battle in Germany from the top of a convent (on which
battle he has written a noble ode); and he saw the French cavalry enter
a town, wiping their bloody swords on the horses' manes. Not long ago he
was in Germany again, I believe to purchase books; for in addition to
his classical scholarship, and his other languages, he is a reader of
German. The readers there, among whom he is popular, both for his poetry
and his love of freedom, crowded about him with affectionate zeal; and
they gave him, what he does not dislike, a good dinner. There is one
of our writers who has more fame than he; but not one who enjoys a
fame equally wide, and without drawback. Like many of the great men in
Germany, Schiller, Wieland, and others, he has not scrupled to become
editor of a magazine; and his name alone has given it among all circles
a recommendation of the greatest value, and such as makes it a grace to
write under him.
</p><p>
"I have since been unable to help wishing, perhaps not very wisely,
that Mr. Campbell would be a little less careful and fastidious in what
he did for the public; for, after all, an author may reasonably be
supposed to do best that which he is most inclined to do. It is our
business to be grateful for what a poet sets before us, rather than to
be wishing that his peaches were nectarines, or his Falernian Champagne.
Mr. Campbell, as an author, is all for refinement and classicality,
not, however, without a great deal of pathos and luxurious fancy."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>[pg xi]</span>
Mr. Campbell's literary labours are perhaps too well known and
estimated to require from us any thing more than a rapid enumeration of
the most popular, as supplementary to this brief memoir. In his studies
he exhibits great fondness for recondite subjects; and will frequently
spend days in minute investigations into languages, which, in the
result, are of little moment. But his ever-delightful theme is Greece,
her arts, and literature. There he is at home: it was his earliest, and
will, probably, be his latest study. There is no branch of poetry or
history which has reached us from the "mother of arts" with which he
is not familiar. He has severely criticised Mitford for his singular
praise of the Lacedaemonians at the expense of the Athenians, and his
preference of their barbarous laws to the legislation of the latter
people. His lectures on Greek Poetry have appeared, in parts, in the
<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>. He has also published <i>Annals of Great
Britain, from the Accession of George III. to the Peace of Amiens</i>;
and is the author of several articles on Poetry and Belles Lettres
in the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopoedia</i>.
</p><p>
Among his poetical works, the minor pieces display considerably more
energy than those of greater length. The <i>Pleasures of Hope</i> is
entitled to rank as a British classic; and his <i>Gertrude</i> is
perhaps one of the most chaste and delicate poems in the language. His
fugitive pieces are more extensively known. Some of them rouse us like
the notes of a war trumpet, and have become exceedingly popular; which
every one who has heard the deep rolling voice of Braham or Phillips in
<i>Hohenlinden</i>, will attest. Neither can we forget the beautiful
<i>Valedictory Stanzas</i> to John Kemble, at the farewell dinner to
that illustrious actor. Another piece, <i>the Last Man</i>, is indeed
fine&mdash;and worthy of Byron. Of Campbell's attachment to his native
country we have already spoken, but as a finely-wrought specimen of
this amiable passion we subjoin a brief poem:
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>
LINES WRITTEN ON VISITING A SCENE IN ARGYLESHIRE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>At the silence of twilight's contemplative hour,</p>
<p class="i2">  I have mused in a sorrowful mood,</p>
<p>On the wind-shaken weeds that embosom the bower,</p>
<p class="i2">  Where the home of my forefathers stood.</p>
<p>All ruin'd and wild is their roofless abode,</p>
<p>And lonely the dark raven's sheltering tree:</p>
<p>And travell'd by few is the grass-cover'd road,</p>
<p>Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trode</p>
<p class="i2">  To his hills that encircle the sea.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yet wandering I found on my ruinous walk,</p>
<p class="i2">  By the dial-stone aged and green,</p>
<p>One rose of the wilderness left on its stalk,</p>
<p class="i2">  To mark where a garden had been.</p>
<p>Like a brotherless hermit, the last of its race,</p>
<p class="i2">  All wild in the silence of nature, it drew,</p>
<p>From each wandering sun-beam, a lonely embrace</p>
<p>For the night-weed and thorn overshadow'd the place,</p>
<p class="i2">  Where the flower of my forefathers grew.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Sweet bud of the wilderness! emblem of all</p>
<p class="i2">  That remains in this desolate heart!</p>
<p>The fabric of bliss to its centre may fall,</p>
<p class="i2">  But patience shall never depart!</p>
<p>Though the wilds of enchantment, all vernal and bright,</p>
<p class="i2">  In the days of delusion by fancy combined</p>
<p>With the vanishing phantoms of love and delight,</p>
<p>Abandon my soul, like a dream of the night,</p>
<p class="i2">  And leave but a desert behind.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii"></a>[pg xii]</span>
<p>Be hush'd, my dark spirit! For wisdom condemns</p>
<p class="i2">  When the faint and the feeble deplore;</p>
<p>Be strong as the rock of the ocean that stems</p>
<p class="i2">  A thousand wild waves on the shore!</p>
<p>Through the perils of chance, and the scowl of disdain,</p>
<p class="i2">  May thy front be unalter'd, thy courage elate!</p>
<p>Yea! even the name I have worshipp'd in vain</p>
<p>Shall awake not the sigh of remembrance again:</p>
<p class="i2">  To bear is to conquer our fate.</p>
</div></div>

Mr. Campbell contributes but little to the pages of the New Monthly
Magazine: still, what he writes is excellent, and as we uniformly
transfer his pieces to the <i>Mirror</i>, we need not recapitulate them.
The fame of Campbell, however, rests on his early productions, which,
though not numerous, are so correct, and have been so fastidiously
revised, that while they remain as standards of purity in the English
tongue, they sufficiently explain why their author's compositions are
so limited in number, "since he who wrote so correctly could not be
expected to write much." His Poetical pieces have lately been collected,
and published in two elegant library volumes, with a portrait esteemed
as an extremely good likeness.
</p><p>
A contemporary critic, speaking of the superiority of Campbell's minor
effusions, when compared with his larger efforts, observes, "His genius,
like the beautiful rays of light that illumine our atmosphere, genial
and delightful as they are when expanded, are yet without power in
producing any active or immediate effect. In their natural expansions
they sparkle to be sure, and sweetly shine; but it is only when
condensed, and brought to bear upon a limited space or solitary object,
that they acquire the power to melt, to burn, or to communicate their
fire to the object they are in contact with." Another writer says, "In
common with every lover of poetry, we regret that his works are so few;
though, when a man has written enough to achieve immortality, he cannot
be said to have trifled away his life. Mr. Campbell's poetry will find
its way wherever the English language shall be spoken, and will be
admired wherever it is known."

Produced by Jonathan Ingram, David Garcia and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
